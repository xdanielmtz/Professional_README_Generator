## Description 
Professional README Generator is a command line application that allows you to input user data and are returned with a profesionally genereated README.
I have developed this application through the Inquirer NPM. Inquirer allowed me to create the actual prompts themselves, making the app function. Other technologies used include node.js and JavaScript. This is a great application for anyone who wants to save time in writing a entire formatted README for their repository.  



## Installation of Repo 
Follow these steps to view the application!
1. Open link in github. - https://github.com/xdanielmtz/Professional_README_Generator
2. Clone with SSH
3. Run "git clone" command in Terminal with the pasted link
4. Run "code ." command to open in VS Code.
5. Enjoy.



## Usage 
Upon opening the command line interface using 'node index.js' command:
You will be prompted with information about your own application repository. 
You will be asked to enter your project title. 
WHEN entering your title, 
THEN it will be placed as the title in the README in the very top.
WHEN entering your project description, 
THEN it will be placed below the section named 'Description'
WHEN you enter your installation instructions,
THEN it will be added in the section named 'Installation of Repo'.
WHEN you enter your usage examples/instructions, 
THEN it will be added to the section titled 'Usage'.
WHEN entering your credits for the project,
THEN it will be added in the section titled 'Credits'.
WHEN you provide examples on how to test your project,
THEN it will be added to the section titled 'Tests'.
WHEN you enter your Github username, 
THEN your Github profile link will be provided under the 'Questions' section for contact. 
WHEN prompted with a selection of licenses, you 
WILL select your desired license by pressing on the space bar and confirming by pressing enter. 
THEN a license name and description will appear under the section titled 'License'.



## Tests
As of current development, I have not written any tests. Although that is the case I assure you the code works as it is meant to be. It can be easily run by initializing it using the command line.
